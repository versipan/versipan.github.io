Iâ€™m a design researcher experienced in uncovering meaningful insights to drive design decisions at various stages of the project, from discovery to validation. I take a strategic approach to research and thrive working on complex projects that require problem-solving skills, analytical thinking and making connections to a bigger picture.

Today, I apply my research skills to a variety of projects at Premera Blue Cross, working with diverse and highly specialized audiences. Along with designing, scoping and running studies, I support multi-disciplinary teams and help establish research processes, effectively involving stakeholders in a way sensitive to the user and equipping teams with tools for improving the user experience.

I come to the UX field with a diverse background, from working as a reporter at a local newspaper to running an aviation magazine, from an interpreter to a charter sales manager in charge of hundred-thousand-dollar flights for business aviation clients. These rich experiences have shaped my biggest assets - deep empathy and problem-solving skills, which I gladly bring to the UX field.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to write me a note and ask about anything UX.
